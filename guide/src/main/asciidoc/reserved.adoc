[[reserved-HTTP-headers, reserved HTTP headers]]
=== HTTP headers

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields[This list] includes all standardized and common non-standard HTTP headers.

[rule, hdr-case]
.HTTP header names
====
Applications MUST treat HTTP header names as case-insensitive as per the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2[HTTP specification].

However, by convention, Kebab-Case with uppercase SHOULD be used for readability and consistency.
====

[rule, cst-header]
.Custom HTTP headers
====
Custom HTTP headers SHOULD be prefixed with the organization's name.

Custom headers that are standardized across Belgian Government organizations use the `BelGov-` prefix.
====

`X-` headers were initially reserved for unstandardized parameters, but the usage of `X-` headers is deprecated (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648[RFC-6648]).
Instead, it is recommended that company specific header' names should incorporate the organization’s name.
However, for backwards compatibility reasons, headers with the `X-` prefix may still be used.
