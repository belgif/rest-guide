== Document

A document resource is a _singular concept_ that is referring to a business entity or object instance. A document’s state representation typically includes both _fields with values_ and <<links,_links_>> to other related resources.

*Documents in a collection*

Most document resources are contained in a _parent <<Collection,collection resource>>_ to which a *variable path segment with identity key* is added.

}
```

[[document-singleton, Singleton documents]]
*Singleton documents*

Documents may also be _singletons_, of which only a single instance exists within the context of its parent, if any. A singleton document's URI ends with a *fixed path segment that is a singular noun*.

a|
```JSON
{ "license": "Any information obtained from this API may not be made public, nor ..."}
```
| `/endUserLicenseAgreement`
|===
====

*Child resources of a document*

A document may have _child resources_ of any type (document, collection or controller) that represent its specific subordinate concepts. When defining child resources, stick to concepts _within the same API_.
Occasionally complex resources have so many related resources that putting all these different concepts in a single API becomes unmanageable. For example, an employer resource could link to related resources describing employees, debts, taxes, mandates, declarations, risks, etc.
In that case, model the related resources in a separate API and link to the principal resource not by including a link (URL) across APIs (see <<rule-hyp-links>>) but just by adding the <<section-identifier, identifier>> of the principal resource in the representation. 

[[section-identifier]]
=== Identifier

[rule, id-choice]
.Choice of identifier
====
The _identity key_ of a document resource is preferably a _natural business identifier_ uniquely identifying the business resource like an ISBN or SSIN. If such key does not exist, a _surrogate or technical key_ can be created.
====

New types of identifiers should be designed carefully. Once an identifier has been introduced, it may get widespread usage in various systems even beyond the scope for which it was initially designed, making it very hard to change its structure later on.

Designing identifiers in a URI structure, as specified in the https://github.com/belgif/thematic/blob/master/URI/iceg_uri_standard.md[ICEG URI standard], is useful as it makes the identifier context-independent and more self-descriptive. A REST API may choose to use a shorter API-local form of a URI identifier because of practical considerations.

When designing an identifier, various requirements may be of importance specific to the use case:

* the governance and lifecycle of identifiers and the entities they represent 
* easy to memorize (e.g. textual identifier like problem types)
* input by user (e.g. web form, over phone/mail)
** easy to type (ignore special separator chars, difference between lower/capital case), limited length
** validation of typing errors, e.g. by checksum, fixed length, ...
** hint on format to recognize purpose of identifier based on its value
* printable (restricted length)
* open to evolve structure for new use cases
* ability to generate identifiers collision-free at multiple independent sources, e.g. by adding a source-specific prefix, using UUIDs, ...
* stable across different deployment environments (e.g. problem type codes)
* hide any business information (e.g. no sequential number that indicates number of resources created)
* not easy to guess a valid identifier, especially for unsecured resources (e.g. no sequentially generated identifier)
* easy to represent in URL parameter without escaping
* sortable (for technical reasons e.g. pagination)

[rule, id-design]
.Designing new identifiers
====
[[new-identifiers]]
For new identifiers, a string based format SHOULD be used: textual lowerCamelCase string codes, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122[UUID^], URI or other custom formats. Take into account the requirements that follow from the ways the identifier will be used.

Each identifier MUST be represented by only one single string value, so that a string equality check can be used to test if two identifiers are identical. This means that capitalization, whitespace or leading zeroes are significant.

In the OpenAPI data type for the identifier, a regular expression may be specified if helpful for input validation or as hint of the structure (e.g. to avoid whitespace or wrong capitalization), but shouldn't be too restrictive in order to be able to evolve the format. 

No business meaning SHOULD be attributed to parts of the identifier. This should be captured in separate data fields. Parts with technical meaning like a checksum are allowed.
====

NOTE: Parts of an identifier may carry some business meaning for easier readability, like the problem type identifiers in this guide, but no application logic should parse and interpret these parts.

WARNING: Don't use database-generated keys as identity keys in your public API to avoid tight coupling between the database schema and API. Having the key independent of all other columns insulates the database relationships from changes in data values or database design (agility) and guarantees uniqueness.

.Identifiers
====
The table below lists some examples of identifiers, though it does not list all possibilities or considerations when designing a new identifier.
|===
| identifier structure | example | OpenAPI type | considerations

|UUID 
| "d9e35127-e9b1-4201-a211-2b52e52508df"

Type defined in https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/src/main/openapi/common/v1/common-v1.yaml[common-v1.yaml]
```YAML
Uuid:

|===
====

A _code_ is a special type of identifier:

* it has an exhaustive list of possible values that doesn't change frequently over time
* each value identifies a concept (examples: a country, a gender, ...).

[rule, cod-design]
.Designing new codes
====
New code types SHOULD be represented as string values in lowerCamelCase.

Depending on context, the OpenAPI data type may enumerate the list of allowed values (see <<enum-rule>>).
====

.Code
====
`GET /refData/paymentMethods/{code}` with `code` of type `PaymentMethodCode`

As string with enumeration:
```YAML
PaymentMethodCode:
  type: string
  enum:
  - cash
  - wireTransfer
  - creditCard
  - debitCard
```

As string with regular expression: 
```YAML
PaymentMethodCode:
  type: string
  pattern: "^[A-Za-z0-9]+$"
  example: "debitCard"
```
====

[rule, id-numer]
.Representing existing numerical identifiers
====
When defining the type for a property representing an existing numerical code or identifier:

* Identifiers that are commonly represented (e.g. when displayed or inputted by a user) with *leading zeros* present SHOULD be represented using a string type. A regular expression SHOULD be specified in the OpenAPI data type to avoid erroneous values (i.e. without leading zeros).
* Otherwise, use an integer based type. It is RECOMMENDED to further restrict the format of the type (e.g. `format: int32` and using `minimum`/`maximum`).

For new identifiers, it is not recommended to use a number type however as stated in <<new-identifiers>>
====

.Representing existing numerical identifiers
====
An employer ID may be of variable length. Leading zeroes are ignored and most of the time not displayed.
```YAML
EmployerId:
  description: Definitive or provisional NSSO number, assigned to each registered employer or local or provincial administration.
  type: integer
  format: int64
  minimum: 0
  maximum: 5999999999
  example: 21197
```

If SSIN has a zero as first digit, it is always displayed.

```YAML
Ssin:
  description: Social Security Identification Number issued by the National Register or CBSS
  type: string
  pattern: '^\d{11}$'
```

Country NIS code is a three-digit code, the first digit cannot be a zero.

```YAML
CountryNisCode:
  description: NIS code representing a country as defined by statbel.fgov.be
  type: integer
  minimum: 100
  maximum: 999
  example: 150 # represents Belgium
```

====

[rule, id-name]
.Identifier name
====
Following naming guidelines should be applied when using an identifier or code in a REST API:

* JSON property:
** within an object that represents the entire or part of a resource: use `id` or `code`
** to reference a resource within another one's representation: property name should designate the relation between the resources (see <<rule-jsn-naming>>); no need to suffix with `id` or `code`
* path parameter: use `id` or `code`, OPTIONALLY prefixed with the resource type to disambiguate when there are multiple identifiers as path parameters
* query search parameter: use same name as the property in the JSON resource representation of the response (see <<filtering>>)
* OpenAPI type: add suffix `Id` or `Code` to distinguish it from the type of the full resource representation

As an exception, use the standardized name for the business identifier if one exists, rather than `id` or `code`.

If multiple identifiers or coding schemes may be used within the same context, a suffix can be added to the name to disambiguate.
====

=== Update

Updating a resource may be done in one of several ways.
One and only one of following patterns should be chosen per resource, unless forced by a backwards compatible change.

In order of preference:

. use PUT with complete objects to update a resource as long as feasible (i.e. do not use PATCH at all).
+
This option is preferred when clients are likely to always take into account the entire resource representation.
If a client ignores some of a resource's properties returned by a consultation, they are likely to be omitted from the PUT request and thus lost.
This scenario may occur when new properties were added during the API lifecycle.
In this case, use of PUT isn't advised.

. Use PATCH with partial objects to only update parts of a resource, whenever possible, using the JSON Merge Patch standard.
+
JSON Merge Patch is limited however, e.g. it doesn't allow for an update of a single element of an array.
If this proves to be an issue, this might however indicate that the array elements might be better modeled as separate sub-resources.

. use POST on a child resource instead of PATCH if the request does not modify the resource in a way defined by the semantics of the media type.
  See <<Controller>> for more information.

Use of the JSON Patch standard, an alternative to JSON Merge Patch, is not recommended, as it proves to be difficult to implement.

[[document-full-update]]
==== Full update

Use `PUT` when you like to do a complete update of a document resource.
All values are replaced by the values submitted by the client.
Absent optional values in the request are set to their default value if one is specified in the OpenAPI specification.

[[document-partial-update]]
==== Partial update

[rule, doc-patch]
.JSON Merge patch
====
Use `PATCH` when you like to do a partial update of a document resource.

The `PATCH` message SHOULD conform to the JSON Merge Patch (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386[RFC 7386]) specification:

* JSON properties in the request overwrite the ones in the previous resource state
* properties with value `null` in the request are removed from the resource
* properties not present in the request are preserved

APIs should support both the media type of JSON merge patch `application/merge-patch+json` as the generic `application/json` JSON media type.

Properties that can be removed, must have `nullable: true` in the OpenAPI 3.0 schema describing the JSON Merge Patch request, which is an exception to <<rule-jsn-null>>.
JSON Merge Patch requests SHOULD be represented by a different schema than other document operations (create, consult or full update), because in a JSON Merge Patch request, required properties may be absent or optional properties may be removed using a `null` value.

[[long-running-tasks]]
=== Long-running tasks

Some operations need to be performed asynchronously, as they take too long to complete.

[rule, lng-task]
.Long-running tasks
====
Long-running tasks MUST be represented as a resource.
The task resource is created using a POST action returning a `202 Accepted` response containing the URL of the task in the `Location` HTTP header.
It can then be fetched by the client to get the processing status of the task.

When GETting the task resource, the response can be:

* Still processing: status `200 OK` and a representation of the task's current status
* Success: status `303 See Other` with the `Location` header containing the URL of the task's output.
* Failure: status `200 OK` with a representation of the task's status, including the reason of the failure
====

Variations on the above may be required, e.g. if the task has no output, the response on success may be `200 OK` without a `Location` header.
The schema https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/src/main/openapi/common/v1/common-v1.yaml[common-v1.yaml] defines the representation of a task's status.

.Long-running task
====
*Submitting the task*

`POST /images/tasks`

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Location: http://www.example.org/images/tasks/1
Date: Sun, 13 Sep 2018 01:49:27 GMT

  "status": {
    "state": "processing",
    "pollAfter": "2018-09-13T01:59:27Z"
  }
}
```

The response `202 Accepted` status indicates that the server accepted the request for processing.
`pollAfter` hints when to check for an updated status at a later time.

*Getting the processing status*

`GET /images/tasks/1`

_When the server is still processing the task_

_When processing has completed_

```
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: http://www.example.org/images/1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks/1",
  "status": {
    "state": "done",
    "completed":"2018-09-13T02:10:00Z"
  }
}
```

The `Location` header refers to the result of the task.

_In case of failure during processing_

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
```
```JSON
{
  "self": "/images/tasks/1",
  "status": {
    "state": "failed",
    "completed":"2018-09-13T02:10:00Z",
    "problem": {
      "instance": "urn:uuid:d9e35127-e9b1-4201-a211-2b52e52508df",
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "status": 400,
      "type": "urn:problem-type:example:invalidImageFormat",
      "href": "https://example.org/example/v1/refData/problemTypes/urn:problem-type:example:invalidImageFormat",
      "detail": "Invalid image format"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the status code is `200 OK` as the retrieval of the task's status succeeded.
The cause of failure is represented using an embedded Problem object, as defined in <<Error handling>>.
