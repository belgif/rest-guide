== Internationalization (I18N)

Textual descriptions part of a resource may need to be offered in the language of a user.

One of following strategies may be chosen for internationalization:

* Do not offer textual descriptions in the API response. Offer them only separate from the data, for example as a dedicated collection resource in the API returning a code list with descriptions. This list can be cached by a client.
* Only include descriptions in a single language, specified by the caller in the `Accept-Language` header.
* Offer descriptions in all applicable languages, i.e. for APIs offered by the Belgian Government in French, Dutch, German and sometimes English as well. This approach is not scalable to a high number of languages.
  The descriptions may be filtered by a `lang` query parameter.

=== Accept-Language

As for <<Media Types>>, HTTP supports content negotiation for the language used in response content.

[rule, int-negot]
.HTTP language headers
====
Users can inform the server that a specific language is requested by adding the `Accept-Language` HTTP header to each request (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-accept-language[RFC 9110]).

Its value is a language tag (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646[RFC 5646]), consisting of a {iso639-1}[ISO 639-1] lowercase language code, optionally followed by an uppercase country code indicating a country-specific variant.
Internationalized APIs of Belgian Federal Government organizations MUST also support the variants for the official Belgian languages ending on `-BE`.

A client may specify multiple languages in `Accept-Language`, with a `q` parameter to indicate their priority.
A wildcard `*` matches any language, but is not always sent by HTTP client implementations.

For best interoperability, clients are recommended to also include language tags without a country suffix, and servers to fall back to the general language or a supported country-specific variant if the requested variant isn't supported.

In case the server could not honor any of the requested languages, it SHOULD return the resource in a default language.

For internationalized content, the `Content-Language` response header MUST be used to indicate the natural language(s) of the intended audience of the response content.

If no `Content-Language` is specified, the default is that the content is intended for all language audiences. This might mean that the sender does not consider it to be specific to any natural language, or that the sender does not know for which language it is intended.

If the resource supports caching, the `Vary: Accept-Language` MUST be included in the response.

.HTTP language headers
====
.Request headers
```
Accept-Language: nl-BE, nl;q=0.9, fr-BE;q=0.8, fr;q=0.7, en;q=0.6, *;q=0.5
```

.Response headers
```
Content-Language: nl
```
====

=== Multi-language descriptions

It may be decided to include all supported translations for descriptions in a resource's representation.

[rule, multi-lang]
.Multi-language descriptions
====
A multi-language description SHOULD be represented by a JSON object with {iso639-1}[ISO 639-1] language codes as property names and the corresponding textual description as values.

An API MAY offer to filter the representation to a single language by using the <<query-param-lang,reserved query parameter>> `lang`.
====

A `LocalizedString` type is defined supporting the three official Belgian languages.

.LocalizedString JSON Schema (from https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/src/main/openapi/common/v1/common-v1.yaml[common-v1.yaml])
```YAML
LocalizedString:
  description: A description specified in multiple languages
  type: object
  properties:
  fr:
    type: string
  nl:
    type: string
  de:
    type: string
```

.Multi-language descriptions
====
.Request
`GET /countries/BE`

.Response
```json
"name": {
 "fr": "Belgique",
 "nl": "BelgiÃ«",
 "de": "Belgien"
}
```

.Filtering a single language
`GET /countries/BE?lang=fr`

```json
"name": {
 "fr": "Belgique"
}
```
