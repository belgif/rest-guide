== Introduction

This style guide for RESTful services is a collaborative effort by several Belgian government institutions, originally under the https://www.gcloud.belgium.be/[G-Cloud] umbrella, before moving to https://www.belgif.be/[Belgif], the Belgian Interoperability Framework.
Its goal is to improve compatibility between RESTful services offered by government institutions or any other organization adopting these guidelines.

This guide is a living document, updated when new interoperability issues arise or when REST-related standards evolve.
All changes are reviewed by the REST design workgroup, in which the Belgian government organizations are represented.
If you find errors or omissions, or want to contribute, you can open an issue or pull request on https://github.com/belgif/rest-guide[GitHub].

These Belgif resources may also be useful when developing RESTful webservices:

* OpenAPI documents for common definitions can be found in the https://github.com/belgif?q=openapi&type=&language=[openapi-* GitHub repositories].
* The https://github.com/belgif/rest-guide-validator[belgif-rest-guide-validator] validates compliance of OpenAPI documents to this guide.
* The https://github.com/belgif/rest-problem-java[belgif-rest-problem-java] library can be used to implement error handling in Java REST clients and server implementations, using <<error-handling,standardized Problem messages>>.
* Semantics of common business data (e.g. social security number, address, ...) are maintained by the REST Functional Working Group in the https://github.com/belgif/fedvoc[Belgif FedVoc repository].
* Securing REST APIs. Guidelines are under development by the REST Security Working Group, based on the OpenID Connect and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0^] standards.
