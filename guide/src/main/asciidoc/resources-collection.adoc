== Collection

A collection resource is a server-managed list of document resources.

[rule, col-name]
.Collection name
====
A plural noun SHOULD be used for collection names, for example 'employers' or 'children'.
====

.Collection name
====
{API}/employers[^] - a collection of employers

{API}/persons/{ssin}/children[^] - a collection of children as a child resource of a person
====

[[collections-consult, Consulting a collection]]
=== Consult

[rule, col-repres]
.Representation of a collection
====
The representation of a collection MUST contain a list of links to child resources:

* A collection result MUST contain an `items` property with an array of objects, each one representing an item in the collection.
* In these objects, a `href` property MUST be present with a link to the resource.
* The unique business identifier SHOULD be present for each item.
* Each item object MAY be extended with some key business properties, needed for display in a master view.
* In case the collection is empty, the `items` property MUST have an empty array as value.
* The `title` property  MAY be used to provide a human-readable description for an item, usable as display text for the link.
* The number of items in the collection result set MAY be included in the response using the `total` property. If the response is paginated, its value MUST correspond to the number of items regardless of pagination, rather than only the number of items in the current page.
====

CAUTION: A collection resource, like other resources, MUST always return a JSON object as top-level data structure to support extensibility (<<rule-evo-object>>). Do not return a JSON array, because the moment you like to add paging, hypermedia links, etc. your API will break.

.Most used response codes

|===

| <<http-200,200>> | OK | Default response code, also when the collection is empty.
| <<http-400,400>> | Bad Request | Generic error on client side. For example, the syntax of the request is invalid.  
| <<http-404,404>> | Not found | The URI provided cannot be mapped to a resource. 
|===

WARNING: <<http-204,204 No content>>  should not be used with GET.

[rule, col-sort]
.Sorting a collection
====
A `sort` multi-value query parameter MAY be provided to allow a client to sort the items of a collection resource on one or more specified properties.
Descending sorting order can be indicated by prefixing the property name with `-`.

The API SHOULD document which properties can be used for sorting, and whether descending order is allowed.
====

.Sort query parameter

[cols="3*"]
|===

| sort
| Multi-value query param with list of properties to sort on.
  Direction is ascending by default. To indicate descending, prefix property with `-`.
|`?sort=age&sort=-name`

[rule,col-embed]
.Getting full representations of collection items
====
When the collection items contain few data, you may want to retrieve them in full when getting the collection.
In this case, the full representations MUST be included in an 'embedded' property as described in <<Embedding resources>>.

[[filtering]]
=== Filtering

[rule, col-filter]
.Filtering items in a collection
====
A collection may support <<query-parameters, query parameters>> to filter its items:

* a query parameter with the name of a document property, filters items on the specified value
* the query parameter `q` is reserved for a full text search on all the document's content
* other filter parameters may be supported, e.g. to look up items within a search period

Unless the API documentation explicitly states otherwise, returned collection items:

* should satisfy ALL filter query parameters (AND-logic)
* have to match ANY of the values of a multi-valued filter query parameter (OR-logic).
====

For example, the query 
`GET /cars?doors=5&color=black&color=blue` should be interpreted by default as: "search for all cars that have 5 doors AND are of color blue OR black".

=== Pagination

[rule, col-paging]
.Paging over a large collection​
====
Collection with too many items MUST support pagination.
There are two pagination techniques:

* offset-based pagination: numeric offset identifies a page
* cursor-based (aka key-based or luke index): a unique key element identifies a page

Cursor-based pagination has some advantages, especially for high volumes.
Take into account the considerations http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/#160[listed in the Zalando API guidelines] before choosing a pagination technique.
====

.Reserved JSON properties:

|===

|`next` | MANDATORY (except for the last page) | hyperlink to the next page
|`prev` | OPTIONAL | hyperlink to the previous page
|`pageSize` | RECOMMENDED | Maximum number of items per page. For the last page, its value should be independent of the number of actually returned items.
| `page` |MANDATORY (offset-based); N/A (cursor-based) | index of the current page of items, should be 1-based (the default and first page is 1)
| `first` | OPTIONAL | hyperlink to the first page
| `last` | OPTIONAL | hyperlink to the last page
| `total` | OPTIONAL | Total number of items across all pages. If query parameters are used to filter the result set, this is the total of the collection result set, not of the entire collection.

|===

The names of the properties with hyperlink values and the `items` property are derived from the https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml[IANA registered link relations].

.Reserved query parameters:

|===

| `pageSize` | OPTIONAL |  maximum number of items per page desired by client; must have a default value if absent.
| `page` | MANDATORY with default value 1 (offset-based); N/A (cursor-based) | the index of page to be retrieved

|Created
|Default response code if the resource is created. 
|<<http-409,409>>

|<<http-303,303>>
|See Other
| The resource already exists.
  May be returned instead of `409 Conflict` if it is considered a normal use case to perform the operation for an already existing resource.

[[remove-collection-items]]
=== Remove

A selection of items can be removed from a collection using the DELETE method. In fact, the collection itself cannot be removed, but it can be emptied if all its items are removed.
By using query parameters, the items to be removed can be filtered.
In order to remove a single specific item from a collection, use <<remove-document, DELETE on the document resource>>.

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|<<delete>>
|/employers
|Delete all the employers documents in the collection.

|name
|query-param
