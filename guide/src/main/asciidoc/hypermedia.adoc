== Hypermedia controls

Thanks to _hypermedia controls_ a client can navigate through the REST API without hardcoding URIs to specific resources. It suffices to know a limited set of entry points and navigate to the desired information. This adds _flexibility_ to the evolution of the API and increases _loose coupling_ between client and server.

[[links]]
=== Links

[rule, hyp-links]
.Links to self and other resources
====
When referencing another resource within the same API, a link SHOULD be added using the `href` attribute.

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to link to resources in other APIs to avoid a tight coupling between the APIs, unless the link target is guaranteed to remain very stable (like the `href` links to standard problem types <<rule-err-problem>>).

Each resource MAY also contain its own location in a `self` attribute at root level of the JSON document.

URIs SHOULD always be absolute.
====

CAUTION: For brevity, most URIs in the style guide examples are shortened, but in reality URIs should always be absolute.

All `href` hyperlinks are derived from this minimal link type:

.HttpLink JSON schema (from https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/src/main/openapi/common/v1/common-v1.yaml[common-v1.yaml])
```YAML
HttpLink:
  description: A base type of objects representing links to resources.
  type: object
  properties:
    href:
      description: Any absolute URI that is using http or https protocol
      type: string
      format: uri
      readOnly: true
```

`self` hyperlinks are derived from the following type:

.SelfLink JSON schema (from https://github.com/belgif/openapi-common/blob/master/src/main/openapi/common/v1/common-v1.yaml[common-v1.yaml])
```YAML
SelfLink:
  description: A base type representing a link to the resource's own location within its representation
  type: object
  properties:
    self:
      description: Absolute URI (http or https) to the the resource's own location.
      type: string
      format: uri
      readOnly: true
```

Links should not be used in request bodies in a PUT, POST or PATCH context, as indicated by the `readOnly: true` property.
In a JSON response, they can be added anywhere.

.Resource links
====
GET {API}/companies/1

[subs="normal"]
```json
{
   "self": "{API}/companies/1[/companies/1^]"
   "owner": {
      "ssin": "12345678901",
      "href": "http://example.org/v1/people/12345678901"
   },
   "website": "https://wwww.mycompany.com"
}
```

PATCH {API}/companies/1

[subs="normal"]
```json
{
   "owner": {
      "ssin": "12345678902"
   },
   "website": "https://wwww.mynewwebsite.com"
}
```

The corresponding JSON schema includes the link types using `allOf`.
As `website` isn't a reference to another API resource, it is not defined using the `HttpLink` type.

```YAML
components:
  schemas:
    Company:
      allOf:
      - "$ref": "./common/v1/common-v1.yaml#/components/schemas/SelfLink"
      - type: object
        properties:
          owner:
            "$ref": "#/components/schemas/PersonReference"
          website:
            type: string
            format: uri
    PersonReference:
      allOf:
        - "$ref": "./common/v1/common-v1.yaml#/components/schemas/HttpLink"
        - type: object
          properties:
            ssin:
              "$ref": "./person-identifier/v1/person-identifier-v1.yaml#/components/schemas/Ssin"
```
====

Hyperlinks for <<Pagination>> inside collections and self-references should use a simple URI value in combination with their corresponding link relations (next, prev, first, last, self) instead of the extensible link type.

[[collection-links]]
.Pagination links
====
[subs="normal"]
```json
{
   "self": "{API}/companies?page=2&pageSize=10[/companies?page=2&pageSize=10^]",
   "prev": "{API}/companies?page=2&pageSize=1[/companies?page=1&pageSize=10^]",
   "next": "{API}/companies?page=2&pageSize=3[/companies?page=3&pageSize=10^]"
}
```
